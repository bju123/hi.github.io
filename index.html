Hello po, Ate Hannah! I have created this anonymous account for me not to recognize so don't be creeped out po, i have good intentions naman po huhu ^^
‎
‎ First of all, we may not know each other po, but since when we started practicing our yell for Foundation Week, I have noticed you po. I was undeniably mesmerized by your goddess beauty from your hair to toe. (may pitik ka te)
‎
‎ When I first saw you po, I was admittedly intimidated because of how you looked and how you spoke to us and it was calmlesly cool. However, I also saw how hands-on you were in handling us from yell to props the whole Foundation week. Honestly, I really admire and appreciate you po and have looked up to you ever since—not just because of that moment, but because of the kind of person I believe you are in real life.
‎
‎ I hope to get to know you better po, Ate Hannah! Keep being intimidating, but with the purest heart, because I know you have that, Ate Mayor, hehe. Hope to see you around the campus po, ate, or sa hallway nalang HAHHAHAHA
‎
‎ Merry Christmas po and Happy Holiday's, ate Hannah!! ^°^💗`;
